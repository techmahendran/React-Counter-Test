Parameters:- 
initialState: The value you want the state to be initially. It can be a value of any type, but there is a special behavior for functions. This argument is ignored after the initial render.
If you pass a function as initialState, it will be treated as an initializer function. It should be pure, should take no arguments, and should return a value of any type. React will call your initializer function when initializing the component, and store its return value as the initial state. See an example below.

Returns:- 
useState returns an array with exactly two values:

The current state. During the first render, it will match the initialState you have passed.
The set function that lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render.

EX:-
const [fn, setFn] = useState(() => someFunction);

function handleClick() {
  setFn(() => someOtherFunction);
}
